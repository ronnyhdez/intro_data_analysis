## Workshop requirements

If you are new to R please install the following software (select according to
your operating system)

 - [RStudio Desktop 1.4.1717](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
 - [The R programming language 4.1.1](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

If you already have R and RStudio installed, please make sure you have the
latest versions.

Also, once you hace RStudio and R installed on your computer, open RStudio and
in the console, copy and paste the following line of code:

```{r packages}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "purrr", "janitor",
                   "readr", "tidyr", "lubridate",
                   "googlesheets4", "fs"))
```

**If a message box opens saying if you want to restart R, please say no!**

It may take a while, but after the proces is finished, you should see the next
message in your console:

```{r succesfull_installation}
The downloaded source packages are in
	‘/tmp/RtmpzvVuLv/downloaded_packages’
```

## Keep up with your learning journey

Everything here is introductory material. If you want to continue learning
about R, it's necesary to learn to work with other people, to be able to 
collaborate, create clean code and tools that help you to automatize jobs.

Some materials that I recommend to keep up learning are:

 - [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
 - [Modern data science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/)
 - [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
